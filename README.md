# Parallel System Architectures - UvA

### Prerequisites
- [SystemC](https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc) (tested under v2.3.3)

### Run the code
1. make
2. ./lab*.bin tracefiles/trace_file_name.trf

Note: In the tracefiles the number near "p" is related to the number of processors. For the 1st lab use only the tracefiles with "p1".


### Labs
- Lab 1: Implement a signle cache
- Lab 2: Implement a multiprocessor coherent cache system

See: lab_assignments.pdf

### Take-Home Assignment
It is a theoretical assignment related with:
- False dependencies and register renaming
- Scheduling in superscalar CPUs using Tomasulo's algorithm
